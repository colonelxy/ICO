# Sample Hardhat Project

CryptoDev Token Contract Address is: 0x5 --network goerlid89c157A6949Bc753b3e3D7B0E6c603F9BdDaFa

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
